/**
* GraphHopper Directions API
*  With the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://www.graphhopper.com/products/) you can integrate A-to-B route planning, turn-by-turn navigation, route optimization, isochrone calculations and other tools in your application.  The GraphHopper Directions API consists of the following RESTful web services:   * [Routing](#tag/Routing-API),  * [Route Optimization](#tag/Route-Optimization-API),  * [Isochrone](#tag/Isochrone-API),  * [Map Matching](#tag/Map-Matching-API),  * [Matrix](#tag/Matrix-API) and  * [Geocoding](#tag/Geocoding-API).  # Explore our APIs  To play and see the Route Optimization in action try our [route editor](https://graphhopper.com/blog/2015/07/21/graphhoppers-new-route-optimization-editor/)  which available in the [dashboard](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/). See how the Routing and Geocoding is integrated in  our route planner website [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps) ([sources](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/0.12/web/src/main/resources/assets)).  And [see below](#section/Explore-our-APIs/Insomnia) for a collection of requests for [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). The request file contains all example requests from this documentation.  ## Get started  1. To use the GraphHopper Directions API you sign up [here](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) and create an API key. 2. Read the documentation of the desired API part below. 3. Start using the GraphHopper Directions API. [Our API clients](#section/Explore-our-APIs/API-Clients) can speed up the integration.  To use the GraphHopper Directions API commercially, you can buy paid package [in the dashboard](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/pricing).  ## Contact Us  If you have problems or questions see the following information:   * [FAQ](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/)  * [Public forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/directions-api)       * [Contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/)  To get informed about the newest features and development follow us at [twitter](https://twitter.com/graphhopper/) or [our blog](https://graphhopper.com/blog/).

Start exploring  ![Postman](./img/postman.png)  # Map Data and Routing Profiles  Currently, our main data source is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). We also integrated other network data providers. This chapter gives an overview about the options you have.  ## OpenStreetMap  #### Geographical Coverage  [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) covers the entire world. If you want to convince yourself whether we can offer appropriate data for your region, please visit [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/). You can edit and modify OpenStreetMap data if you find that important information is missing, for example, a weight restriction for a bridge. [Here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) is a beginner's guide that shows how to add data.  If you edited data, we usually consider your data after 1 week at latest.  #### Supported Vehicle Profiles  The Routing, Matrix and Route Optimizations support the following vehicle profiles:  Name       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon -----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------- car        | Car mode              | car access                | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png) small_truck| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png) truck      | Truck like a MAN or Mercedes-Benz Actros | height=3.7m, width=2.6+0.5m, length=12m, weight=13000 + 13000 kg, hgv=yes, 3 Axes | ![truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/truck.png) scooter    | Moped mode | Fast inner city, often used for food delivery, is able to ignore certain bollards, maximum speed of roughly 50km/h | ![scooter image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/scooter.png) foot       | Pedestrian or walking | foot access         | ![foot image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/foot.png) hike       | Pedestrian or walking with priority for more beautiful hiking tours and potentially a bit longer than `foot`  | foot access         | ![hike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/hike.png) bike       | Trekking bike avoiding hills | bike access  | ![bike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/bike.png) mtb        | Mountainbike          | bike access         | ![Mountainbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/mtb.png) racingbike| Bike preferring roads | bike access         | ![racingbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/racingbike.png)  **Please note, that turn restrictions are considered only with `ch.disable=true`.**  For the free package you can only choose from `car`, `bike` or `foot`.  We also offer a sophisticated `motorcycle` profile powered by the [Kurviger](https://kurviger.de/en) Routing. Kurviger favors curves and slopes while avoiding cities and highways.  Also we offer custom vehicle profiles with different properties, different speed profiles or different access options. To find out more about custom profiles, please [contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/).  ## TomTom  If you need to consider traffic, you can purchase the TomTom add-on.  Please note:   * Currently we only offer this for our [Route Optimization](#tag/Route-Optimization-API).  * This add-on uses the TomTom road network and historical traffic information only. Live traffic is not yet considered. Read more about [how this works](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2017/11/06/time-dependent-optimization/).  * Additionally to our terms your end users need to accept the [TomTom Eula](https://www.graphhopper.com/tomtom-end-user-license-agreement/).  * We do *not* use the TomTom web services. We only use their data with our software.   [Contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/) for more details.  #### Geographical Coverage  We offer  - Europe including Russia - North, Central and South America - Saudi Arabia - United Arab Emirates - South Africa - Australia  #### Supported Vehicle Profiles  Name       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon -----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------- car        | Car mode              | car access                | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png) small_truck| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png)

    /**
    * Execute a routing request
    * ### Introduction  ![Routing screenshot](./img/routing-example.png)  The Routing is part of the GraphHopper Directions API. Routing is the process of finding the best path connecting two or more points, where the meaning of &#x27;&#x27;best&#x27;&#x27; depends on the vehicle and use case.  ### Navigation If you plan to use the Routing for navigation, have a look at our [open source demo navigation application](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example) and adapt it to your needs.  ### Fast To get started using this API, just provide two or more points and retrieve the fastest route through the road network that connects them. This type of request is heavily optimized for query performance, so it does not take turn restrictions into account, and it does not allow for some advanced features. ### Flexible Enable turn restrictions and unlock further flexible features via &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;. Please note that some options make the request more expensive, see the [FAQ](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/) for more details. 
    * @param point The points for which the route should be calculated. Format: &#x60;[latitude,longitude]&#x60;. Specify at least an origin and a destination. Via points are possible. The maximum number depends on your plan.  
    * @param pointHint The &#x60;point_hint&#x60; is typically a road name to which the associated &#x60;point&#x60; parameter should be snapped to. Specify no &#x60;point_hint&#x60; parameter or the same number as you have &#x60;point&#x60; parameters.  (optional)
    * @param snapPrevention Optional parameter to avoid snapping to a certain road class or road environment. Currently supported values are &#x60;motorway&#x60;, &#x60;trunk&#x60;, &#x60;ferry&#x60;, &#x60;tunnel&#x60;, &#x60;bridge&#x60; and &#x60;ford&#x60;. Multiple values are specified like &#x60;snap_prevention&#x3D;ferry&amp;snap_prevention&#x3D;motorway&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param vehicle The vehicle profile for which the route should be calculated.  (optional)
    * @param locale The locale of the resulting turn instructions. E.g. &#x60;pt_PT&#x60; for Portuguese or &#x60;de&#x60; for German.  (optional)
    * @param elevation If &#x60;true&#x60;, a third coordinate, the altitude, is included with all positions in the response. This changes the format of the &#x60;points&#x60; and &#x60;snapped_waypoints&#x60; fields of the response, in both their encodings. Unless you switch off the &#x60;points_encoded&#x60; parameter, you need special code on the client side that can handle three-dimensional coordinates. A request can fail if the vehicle profile does not support elevation. See the features object for every vehicle profile.  (optional)
    * @param details Optional parameter to retrieve path details. You can request additional details for the route: &#x60;street_name&#x60; and &#x60;time&#x60;. For all motor vehicle profiles, we additionally support &#x60;max_speed&#x60;, &#x60;toll&#x60;, &#x60;road_class&#x60;, &#x60;road_environment&#x60;, and &#x60;surface&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param optimize Normally, the calculated route will visit the points in the order you specified them. If you have more than two points, you can set this parameter to &#x60;true&#x60; and the points may be re-ordered to minimize the total travel time. Keep in mind that the limits on the number of locations of the Route Optimization applies, and the request is more expensive.  (optional)
    * @param instructions If instructions should be calculated and returned  (optional)
    * @param calcPoints If the points for the route should be calculated at all.  (optional)
    * @param debug If &#x60;true&#x60;, the output will be formatted.  (optional)
    * @param pointsEncoded Allows changing the encoding of location data in the response. The default is polyline encoding, which is compact but requires special client code to unpack. (We provide it in our JavaScript client library!) Set this parameter to &#x60;false&#x60; to switch the encoding to simple coordinate pairs like &#x60;[lon,lat]&#x60;, or &#x60;[lon,lat,elevation]&#x60;. See the description of the response format for more information.  (optional)
    * @param type Specifies the media type for the response. For &#x60;json&#x60;, it will be &#x60;application/json&#x60;. For &#x60;gpx&#x60;, it will be &#x60;application/gpx+xml&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param ch.disable Use this parameter in combination with one or more parameters from below.  (optional)
    * @param weighting Determines the way the &#x27;&#x27;best&#x27;&#x27; route is calculated. Default is &#x60;fastest&#x60;. Other options are &#x60;shortest&#x60; (e.g. for &#x60;vehicle&#x3D;foot&#x60; or &#x60;bike&#x60;) and &#x60;short_fastest&#x60; which finds a reasonable balance between &#x60;shortest&#x60; and &#x60;fastest&#x60;. Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param heading Favour a heading direction for a certain point. Specify either one heading for the start point or as many as there are points. In this case headings are associated by their order to the specific points. Headings are given as north based clockwise angle between 0 and 360 degree. This parameter also influences the tour generated with &#x60;algorithm&#x3D;round_trip&#x60; and forces the initial direction.  Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param headingPenalty Time penalty in seconds for not obeying a specified heading. Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param passThrough If &#x60;true&#x60;, u-turns are avoided at via-points with regard to the &#x60;heading_penalty&#x60;. Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param blockArea Block road access via a point with the format &#x60;latitude,longitude&#x60; or an area defined by a circle &#x60;lat,lon,radius&#x60; or a rectangle &#x60;lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2&#x60;. Separate several values with &#x60;;&#x60;. Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param avoid Specify which road classes and environments you would like to avoid.  Possible values are &#x60;motorway&#x60;, &#x60;primary&#x60;, &#x60;secondary&#x60;, &#x60;tertiary&#x60;, &#x60;trunk&#x60;, &#x60;residential&#x60;, &#x60;steps&#x60;, &#x60;living_street&#x60;, &#x60;track&#x60;, &#x60;toll&#x60;, &#x60;ferry&#x60;, &#x60;tunnel&#x60;, &#x60;bridge&#x60; and &#x60;ford&#x60;. Separate several values with &#x60;;&#x60;. Obviously not all the values make sense for all vehicle profiles e.g. &#x60;bike&#x60; is already forbidden on a &#x60;motorway&#x60;. Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param algorithm Rather than looking for the shortest or fastest path, this lets you solve two different problems related to routing: With &#x60;round_trip&#x60;, the route will get you back to where you started. This is meant for fun (think of a bike trip), so we will add some randomness. With &#x60;alternative_route&#x60;, we give you not one but several routes that are close to optimal, but not too similar to each other. You can control both of these features with additional parameters, see below. Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param roundTrip.distance If &#x60;algorithm&#x3D;round_trip&#x60;, this parameter configures approximative length of the resulting round trip. Requires &#x60;ch.disable&#x3D;true&#x60;.  (optional)
    * @param roundTrip.seed If &#x60;algorithm&#x3D;round_trip&#x60;, this sets the random seed. Change this to get a different tour for each value.  (optional)
    * @param alternativeRoute.maxPaths If &#x60;algorithm&#x3D;alternative_route&#x60;, this parameter sets the number of maximum paths which should be calculated. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.  (optional)
    * @param alternativeRoute.maxWeightFactor If &#x60;algorithm&#x3D;alternative_route&#x60;, this parameter sets the factor by which the alternatives routes can be longer than the optimal route. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.  (optional)
    * @param alternativeRoute.maxShareFactor If &#x60;algorithm&#x3D;alternative_route&#x60;, this parameter specifies how similar an alternative route can be to the optimal route. Increasing can lead to worse alternatives.  (optional)
    * @return RouteResponse
